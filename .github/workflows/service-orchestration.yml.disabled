# DISABLED WORKFLOW - TOO COMPLEX FOR CURRENT SETUP
# This workflow was causing CI/CD failures due to missing secrets and complex orchestration
# Replaced with simpler ci-cd-simple.yml workflow
# Can be re-enabled later when proper infrastructure is in place

name: Service Orchestration & Automation (DISABLED)

# Disabled by renaming to .yml.disabled
# Original complex workflow moved here for future reference

# on:
#   schedule:
#     - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC
#     - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
#   workflow_dispatch:

# This workflow required:
# - SLACK_WEBHOOK secret
# - RAILWAY_TOKEN secret
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID secret
# - DATABASE_URL secret
# - Multiple service endpoints
# - Complex service discovery logic

# For now, using simpler ci-cd-simple.yml workflow that focuses on:
# - Code validation
# - Basic testing
# - Documentation checks
# - Security scanning
# - No external dependencies
