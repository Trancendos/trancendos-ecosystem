# Trancendos Ecosystem Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture of the Trancendos Ecosystem.

## Guiding Principles

The architecture is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Security**: As a financial application, security is of the utmost importance. The architecture is designed to be PCI DSS compliant and to follow best practices for securing sensitive data.
- **Scalability**: The application is designed to be highly scalable to handle a large number of users and transactions.
- **Observability**: The architecture includes a comprehensive monitoring stack to provide visibility into the health and performance of the application.
- **Developer Experience**: The architecture is designed to be easy for developers to work with, with a focus on automation and CI/CD.

## System Components

The Trancendos Ecosystem is composed of the following high-level components:

- **Frontend**: A single-page application (SPA) built with React and a micro-frontends architecture.
- **Backend**: A set of microservices built with Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI/Django).
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database for transactional data and a Redis cache for caching and session storage.
- **Infrastructure**: The application is containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring**: A monitoring stack that includes Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and the ELK Stack for logging.

## Service Breakdown

### Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It is designed with a micro-frontends architecture, which allows for different parts of the application to be developed and deployed independently.

### Backend

The backend is composed of a set of microservices, each with a specific responsibility. The services are built with a combination of Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI/Django), depending on the specific requirements of the service.

- **Alervato**: The core financial management and transaction processing platform.
- **Luminous-MastermindAI**: An AI-powered analytics and decision support system.

### Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for transactional data. A Redis cache is used for caching and session storage to improve performance and scalability.

### Infrastructure

The application is containerized with Docker and is intended to be orchestrated with Kubernetes. A CI/CD pipeline, managed by GitHub Actions, is used to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

### Monitoring

The monitoring stack includes the following components:

- **Prometheus**: For collecting metrics from the application.
- **Grafana**: For visualizing the metrics collected by Prometheus.
- **ELK Stack**: For collecting, storing, and analyzing logs from the application.
