# Trancendos Ecosystem

## Financial Autonomy Platform with AI-Powered Scalability

This repository contains the core infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, and documentation for the Trancendos Ecosystem. It is designed to provide a production-ready foundation for the Alervato financial management platform and Luminous-MastermindAI components.

**Note:** This repository does not contain the source code for the individual services (frontend, Java backend, Python backend). It is intended to be used as a template and starting point for deploying the Trancendos Ecosystem.

## Architecture Overview

The Trancendos Ecosystem is built on a microservices architecture, with a focus on security, scalability, and observability.

### Core Components
- **Alervato**: The primary financial management and transaction processing platform.
- **Luminous-MastermindAI**: An AI-powered analytics and decision support system that integrates with Alervato.
- **Security Layer**: A robust security layer that is PCI DSS compliant, providing authentication and authorization for all services.
- **Monitoring Stack**: A comprehensive monitoring stack for observability and compliance tracking.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with a micro-frontends architecture.
- **Backend**: A combination of Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI/Django) for different microservices.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL as the primary database, with Redis for caching.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, with a CI/CD pipeline managed by GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and the ELK Stack for logging.

## Production Readiness Status

This section tracks the implementation status of the key features of the Trancendos Ecosystem.

### Security & Compliance âœ…
- [x] OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect implementation for secure authentication.
- [x] PCI DSS compliance framework to meet industry standards for handling financial data.
- [x] Financial data encryption standards for both in-transit and at-rest data.
- [x] Audit logging infrastructure to track all system activity.

### Automation & CI/CD ðŸš§
- [x] GitHub Actions pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- [x] Docker containerization for all services.
- [ ] Kubernetes orchestration for automated deployment, scaling, and management.
- [ ] Security scanning integration to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase.

### Monitoring & Observability ðŸš§
- [x] Prometheus metrics collection from all services.
- [x] Grafana dashboards for visualizing key metrics.
- [ ] Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry to trace requests across services.
- [ ] Real-time alerting system to notify the team of any issues.

## Quick Start

This section provides instructions for setting up the development environment.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 18+
- Java 11+
- Python 3.9+

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Trancendos/trancendos-ecosystem.git
cd trancendos-ecosystem

# Start the development environment using Docker Compose
# Note: This will pull the required Docker images for the services.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Initialize the services (this is a placeholder for the actual setup script)
npm run setup:dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to the staging environment
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to the production environment (requires approval)
npm run deploy:production
```

## Security Notice

This application is designed to handle sensitive financial data and requires strict security measures.

- All API endpoints are rate-limited and require authentication.
- Data is encrypted both in transit (using TLS) and at rest.
- Regular security audits and compliance checks are performed.
- Incident response procedures are documented in `/docs/security`.

## Documentation

- [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api.md)
- [Security Guidelines](docs/security.md)
