## Future Developments

### AI-Powered Financial Advisor

A key strategic goal for the Trancendos Ecosystem is the development of an advanced AI-powered financial advisor. This system will be designed to:

*   **Manage Financial Frameworks:** Ensure compliance with financial regulations and internal policies.
*   **Analyze New Income Opportunities:** Identify and evaluate new passive income generation strategies and models.
*   **Expand Investment Portfolio:** Proactively manage and grow a portfolio of services and investments over time.

This feature will be built upon the foundational "Finance and Accountancy Module" and will be a major focus of future development efforts.
